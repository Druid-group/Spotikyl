Our goal with this project was to add on a level of interactivity that is not currently included on the original spotify.  During lecture break, our instructor would ask for suggestions for music to play.  We found that the options would be limited by those offering suggestions, so we thouht we could create an app where individuals can vote on a playlist to shape which music gets played.  This eliminates the bias of waiting for volunteers and allows the group to vote on multiple song at once. Utilizing Express, React and the Spotify api we created an interacive front end that plays music from an approved playlist. Using Sprocket Io, we implemented a voting system utilizing an invisible user ID, allowing each user to vote on individual songs, once, that they want to hear.  This allows real time input from users and allows anonymous interaction.

Once on the launch page click the "Let's go" button, this takes you to Spotify's authorization page, click the agree button and you land on our dashboard.  The dashboard will show in the player the current song, and to the right is our current playlist.  You can utilize the up and down arrows to cast your votes.
